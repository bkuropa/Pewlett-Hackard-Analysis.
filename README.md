# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
## Number 7 by Bryan Kuropatwa

## Overview Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  As in introduction to SQL, we take on a project for a company duly concerned about the retirement age of its employees.  This also involves efforts to hire more xxx employers who are actively searching for full-time positions where they can continue to advance their careers.  This involves a detailed analysis into departments, managers, employees and the relationship between all three.  Throughout the project, many tables will be examined, created, and querried with the SQL code.
