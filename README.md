# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
## Number 7 by Bryan Kuropatwa

## Overview Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  As in introduction to SQL, we take on a project for a company duely concerned about the retirement age of its employees.  This also involves efforts to hire more xxx employers who are actively searching for full-time positions where they can continue to advance their careers.  This involves a detailed analysis into departments, managers, employees and the relationship between all three.  Throughout the project, many tables will be examined, created, and querried with the SQL code.

## Results
 ### Part 1 - Detailed Analysis of Retiring Employees
- Retirement titles is a simple table with very important information within.  It contains the number of employees who will retire in the next ~5 years and their position at the company.  For example, there will be almost 26,000 senior engineers retiring in the near future.

- The unique titles table is much longer, carrying the title for each employee ready for retirement as well as an employee number for ease of look-ups later on.

### Part 2 - Understanding of Potential Mentorship Program
- The mentorship table indicates the most senior employees in the business and what they may be able to offer as mentors for up-and-coming employees at the company.

- The query is a longer escapade with respect to SQL language and involves the combination of employees, departments and titles into one entity.  This way, the correct columns can be pulled with a heavy influence on birthdates and employment dates.

## Summary


Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
